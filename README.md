# Week [#] Knowledge Base Learning Sandbox

## Card Topics

- Card 1: CSS Scroll-Behavior: Smooth Scrolling Without Javascript - Issue #64
- Card 2: Alternative Text: Writing Effective Image Descriptions - Issue #47

## Card 1 Learning Journey

### Experiments Conducted

- Using Copilot to clarify assignment requirements
- Using the Agent to explain terminal commands and responses
- Running different commands when errors ensued

### Key Discoveries

- Copilot can help fix errors in the terminal
- Titles need to be enclosed in double quotation marks so it is not seen as a key value
- The Agent can offer multiple suggestions and run commands automatically

### Challenges Faced

- Running into several errors due to minor mistakes like spacing 
- Bash not running properly because of said errors
- Needing to put `css` next to the ``` instead of bash so it could run properly

## Card 2 Learning Journey

### Experiments Conducted

- Card 2 was easier to complete after figuring out why Card 1 was not working

### Key Discoveries

- Fixed my formatting that caused errors in previous card

### Challenges Faced

- Little to none, learned from the errors I made on Card 1

## Weekly Reflection

### What concepts clicked for you this week?

Using the different modes of Copilot such as Ask, Agent, and Build. 

### What are you still exploring?

How to use Github in some areas. Issues are making more sense, but creating branches was a bit confusing. I also still find using Bash confusing and how to find proper commands. 

### How did AI assistance help your learning?

Copilot helped me understand a lot of issues I was encountering by explaining or clarifying questions that I had. 

### What will you do differently next week?

Use more of the Ask component of Copilot to help clarify issues or any questions that I have.
